## PancrePal - An Intelligent RAG Platform for Pancreatic Cancer Patients


**Project Introduction:**
PancrePal is a RAG application developed and launched by a fellow patient, SamQin (myself as an pancretic cancer patient & AI developer), with the main purpose of assisting 200K+ newly diagnosed patients and survivors each year to overcome the professional medical and treatment information gap between patients and doctors. With PancrePal, patients can receive 7x24 hour assistance to efficiently and accurately understand their medical conditions, treatment terminology, standardized treatment guidelines, and the complex information of comprehensive treatments. This helps them overcome panic emotions, choose scientific and effective treatment routes, and ultimately gain longer treatment benefits, that is, the window of life.

PancrePal has been online for 7 months, helping over 2000+ patients with stable support, and has gathered professional doctors who support the application of AI technology, patient communities, and open-source technology communities and public welfare practitioners. The launch of PancrePal has pioneered and validated a new model for AI intelligent services for patients with all types of cancer, looking forward to the open-source community promoting more similar applications for tens of millions of new patients. These services include providing convenience for patients with tumors such as lung cancer, breast cancer, thyroid cancer, liver cancer, and intestinal cancer.
