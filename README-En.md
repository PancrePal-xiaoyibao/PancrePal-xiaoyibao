## PancrePal - An Intelligent RAG Platform for Pancreatic Cancer Patients


## Project Introduction:
PancrePal is a RAG application developed and launched by a fellow patient, SamQin (myself as an pancretic cancer patient & AI developer), with the main purpose of assisting 200K+ newly diagnosed patients and survivors each year to overcome the professional medical and treatment information gap between patients and doctors. With PancrePal, patients can receive 7x24 hour assistance to efficiently and accurately understand their medical conditions, treatment terminology, standardized treatment guidelines, and the complex information of comprehensive treatments. This helps them overcome panic emotions, choose scientific and effective treatment routes, and ultimately gain longer treatment benefits, that is, the window of life.

PancrePal has been online for 7 months, helping over 2000+ patients with stable support, and has gathered professional doctors who support the application of AI technology, patient communities, and open-source technology communities and public welfare practitioners. The launch of PancrePal has pioneered and validated a new model for AI intelligent services for patients with all types of cancer, looking forward to the open-source community promoting more similar applications for tens of millions of new patients. These services include providing convenience for patients with tumors such as lung cancer, breast cancer, thyroid cancer, liver cancer, and intestinal cancer.

##Project Open-Source Principles and Oath:

By using the PancrePal project's open-source framework, which includes, but is not limited to, the technical framework, product framework, and knowledge base data in whole or in part, you automatically agree to accept the following principles and oath:

1. **Non-Commercial Use for Patients:** We will never charge patients and their families for the use of the "PancrePal" intelligent assistant and will not use it for any commercialized traffic diversion.

2. **Respect for Intellectual Property:** We will respect the ownership rights of those who contribute knowledge and will not misuse the knowledge base for profit. The sources of the knowledge base will be disclosed publicly.

3. **Standardized Treatment Orientation:** All content will be based on the principle of "standardized treatment," and "evidence-based" will be the first principle for the admission into the knowledge base.

## Version Introduction and Roadmap

### V1.0

Features Introduction

Knowledge Base Construction:
1.1 Based on the principle of "standardized treatment," carefully selected and imported guidelines for standardized treatment of pancreatic cancer (including guidelines and patient guides from CSCO/China and NCCN/USA), covering more than 20 pancreatic cancer complications and comprehensive treatment-related guidelines (white blood cells/platelets/obstruction/jauice intervention, etc.).
1.2 Imported the comprehensive treatment experience treasure content accumulated by the pancreatic patient community.
1.3 Covered targeted therapy and gene therapy, definitions of genes related to pancreatic cancer, and key points to note in gene therapy.
1.4 Imported standards for nutritional support and treatment.
1.5 Selected and imported featured articles on comprehensive treatment.

Agent Construction
2.1 Agent creation.
2.2 Prompt configuration.
2.3 LLM (Large Language Model) configuration and selection.
2.4 Tool matching.
2.5 Dialogue testing.
2.6 Dialogue template management.

Service Management
3.1 API creation and management.
3.2 External usage link creation and management.
3.3 Service statistics and dashboard.

System Management
4.1 User permissions/role management.
4.2 Log management.

WeChat Management
5.1 WeChat bot integration and automated monitoring.
5.2 Bot dialogue configuration management.
5.3 Other application management.

Enterprise WeChat Management
6.1 Enterprise WeChat application integration.
6.2 Bot dialogue configuration management.
6.3 Other application feature management.

The operation system is an indispensable part of the knowledge base, including:
7.1 Knowledge system design.
7.2 Knowledge system evaluation and grading.
7.3 Knowledge base structure design.
7.4 Knowledge content import and verification.
7.5 Knowledge base optimization, compression, and iteration.

V2.0 Version
En-route Features:

1.1 Image Recognition: Capable of uploading and recognizing content from monitoring reports, intelligently interpreting the definition and abnormalities of disease indicators, facilitating patients' understanding of the significance of indicators and timely interaction with the attending physician.
1.2 Audio-Video Knowledge Base.
1.3 Voice Interaction: Adding stable voice interaction capabilities to facilitate communication with the elderly.
1.4 New Version Knowledge Base System
1.4.1 Pancreatic Cancer Comprehensive Treatment Medications.
1.4.2 Pancreatic Cancer Comprehensive Treatment Nutrition Menus.
1.5 Stable WeChat Bot: Urgently needs technical contributors from the open-source community for assistance.

## Open-Source expertise Recruitment
** More stable WeChat Bot**: Many patient groups are gathered within the WeChat ecosystem, hence the need for a stable WeChat bot. Currently, we are using free open-source tools including Chatgpt-on-wechat, which has an issue of going offline every 2-3 days, significantly affecting the use of patients and the requirements of applications like PancrePal that serve hundreds of thousands of users. If there are supporters in the open-source community, please contact me.
