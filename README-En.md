## PancrePal - An Intelligent RAG Platform for Pancreatic Cancer Patients


## Project Introduction:
Pancrepal was developed and launched by fellow patient SamQin as a RAG application, aimed at helping hundreds of thousands of newly diagnosed patients and survivors each year to bridge the information gap between medical professionals and patients regarding specialized medical and treatment information. With Pancrepal, patients can access 24/7 support to efficiently and accurately understand their condition, treatment terms, standardized treatment guidelines, and the complex information surrounding comprehensive care. This enables patients to overcome panic, choose scientific and effective treatment routes, and ultimately achieve longer treatment benefits, thus extending their life window.

Pancrepal has been online for 8 months, assisting over 3000 patients by providing stable support and gathering professional doctors who endorse AI technology applications, patient groups, the open-source tech community, and social welfare advocates. In July 2024, the project officially went open source, thanks to prominent figures like @RichardLin and Mr. Zhuang from the Open Source Society, leading and driving the establishment, organization, promotion, and enhancement of the open-source community.
The launch of Pancrepal has pioneered and validated a new model for AI intelligent services for cancer patients across all types of tumors. We look forward to partners in the open-source community to take action and use their unique "technology + AI + humanities" capabilities to replicate this project, swiftly providing more similar applications for tens of millions of CA patients and offering them choices.

We highly recommend developing and launching related AI assistants for patients with lung cancer, breast cancer, thyroid cancer, liver cancer, and colorectal cancer. Please feel free to contact the project organizers to exchange information and join hands for public welfare! 

### Take a try of PancrePal family here 

https://aibot.samqin.asia - An app aiming to help patients & familiy to understand therapy terms and treatment standard knowledges
https://xingma.samqin.asia - An AI chatbotxRAG app specifically designed for pancreatic patients and their families. It aims to provide psychological counseling and stress relief in conjunction with comprehensive treatment, helping patients and their families maintain a stable mental state to achieve more positive treatment outcomes.

Centered around comprehensive treatment, "Pancrepal Family" focuses on three main aspects of cancer treatment: medical care, nutritional support, and psychological support, which directly influence the outcomes, known as the "window of life."

In addition to AI-powered patient applications like Pancrepal, which assist in the treatment process, we are also introducing specialized tools such as "StarMom Chat - Pancreatic CA Patient Psychological Soothing Assistant" for psychological support, and "Little Foodie - Patient Nutrition and Recipe Assistant" for nutritional guidance. Together, these form a unified triad of comprehensive applications aimed at efficiently providing information to patients and their families.

We encourage replication of this project to develop applications for multiple cancer types, emphasizing the necessity of integrating these three aspects for effective patient care.
